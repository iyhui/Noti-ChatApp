## Proposal

It's quarantine - we're all playing Animal Crossing. As a person who doesn't want to speak to people who aren't playing the game, I (and many others) accidently leave people on read while trying to respond to actual players. This is a seperate chat app for Animal Crossing enthusiasts. We'll never have to open another messaging app and accidentally leave someone on read. Plus, this app is way cooler and on theme.  

### Must have (P1)

:partly_sunny: Users will be able to register and login (user authentication). 

:partly_sunny: Users will be able to communicate with each other through different devices/accounts.

:partly_sunny: User will be able to navigate through different screens.

### Nice to have (P2)

:cloud: Notifications Popup 

:cloud: Notification Sounds

:cloud: A list of all threads/convos

### Installation

:cyclone: Download App

:cyclone: Install pods ("Pod Install" in the terminal). Make sure you're in the Noti directory.

:cyclone: Open Workspace and run the program (command + R)


:cyclone: Create your own user/password

:cyclone: Or use premade accounts: user1@690.com, user2@690.com. Password is the same and already prestored.
